# ml-kraken

ML-Kraken is a fully cloud-based solution designed and built to improve models management process. Each math model is treated as a separate network service that can be exposed under IP address and defined port. This approach is called MaaS (model as a service).

ML-kraken combines two pieces, backend based on serverless solution and frontend which is an Angular based app. As a native execution platform, we decided to use AWS public cloud.
